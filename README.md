# Hall of Fame: Best and Worst Data Graphics

In this lab, you will write a blog post about a data graphic that
inspires you and a data graphic that you think does a poor job
at conveying a message.

Record all references used (informal: author, title, page number, and/or link)

## So Many Data Visualizations

TODO: Read the Nature Data Visualization
[Hall of Fame](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3657.pdf), along
with the
[chartio blog post](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/essential-chart-types-for-data-visualization/)
and the partial chapter on
[Visualizations p. 19-32](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/allegheny-ebooks/reader.action?docID=427614).
Use these to inspire you to think about both data and visuals.

- What makes a good visual?
- Did your opinion change after reading these materials?
- What led you to hold your opinions to begin with?

Note: This blog post is meant to be informal, but presentable.
In other words, you don't need to write long paragraphs to support a
thesis statement. Rather, use this document to brainstorm. Write down
responses to the given questions, and if other relevant points come to
mind, feel free to also jot those down.

When you are done, please read over and reorganize the document
to make a presentable deliverable. This will in fact BE PRESENTED on Friday
morning, Jan 26th in a 2-minute lightning talk to your classmates. Again, it is
informal in the sense that we are interested in
learning what you are interested in, and why!

More guidelines:

TODO: In 1-3 sentences, write why you are interested in the topic of Data Exploration.

TODO: Obtain two data graphics.

- TODO: Label the one you like `good_data_graphic_example.jpeg` matching exactly (except the end can be jpg, or png, etc).
- TODO: Label the other one `bad_data_graphic_example.jpeg` matching exactly (except the end can be jpg, or png, etc).
- TODO: Upload the images to your GitHub repository under assets/images

TODO: Create a blog post explaining why you like or don't like them.

TODO: Display the data graphics (doesn't have to be consecutive)

TODO: Think about aspects like:

- What makes a good visual?
- What are the contexts of the graphics you chose?
- Why do they exist at all?
- What type of visual it is most like, according to chartio, or another resource.

TODO: Think about the new technical skills you used to
create this post and briefly explain and describe them.
For example, use of GitHub, Markdown, Gatorgrade, etc.

TODO: Commit your work in GitHub as you go, at least 5. Be sure the final version is
committed before the due date because access will be lost after the due date.

TODO: Make sure all TODO markers are deleted. Also be sure to include at least 5 markdown headings.

TODO: To finish off the assignment, make sure that all gatorgrade checks pass in GitHub Actions.
The GitHub Actions report can be seen under the Actions tab near the top of the GitHub web interface.
Click on Actions, then the top run, the build, the build again, ... until you can see a report. Check to
see what gatorgrade checks still need to be passed.

TODO: Don't hesitate to post questions on Discord (part of participation)

When you are done, please read over and reorganize the document
to make a presentable deliverable. This will in fact BE PRESENTED on Friday
morning, Jan 26th in a 1 or 2-minute lightning talk to your classmates. Again, it is
informal in the sense that we are interested in
